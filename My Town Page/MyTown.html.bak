            My hometown is San Jose, California. </h2>
          <p style="background-color: #238d00; color: white;"> The city I was
            born and raised in, San Jose, is a pretty big city with a population
            of almost 1 million people. The weather is usually somewhat mild
            (usually around 70ish degrees) but it can get really hot in the
            summer. It hardly rains in San Jose causing the climate to be
            somewhat arid in the mountains around the city. San Jose itself is
            located in a valley and its area size is 181.4 mi². Some things to
            do are visit the local sports stadiums to watch football and soccer
            games, visit the science and art museums, and go hiking in the
            nearby mountains.</p>
